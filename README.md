# SOLID Principles
This document explains the SOLID principles in simple terms, using no code examples. The goal is to make these concepts easy to understand for anyone, even if you're new to programming. We'll use Node.js as the context, but the ideas apply to any programming language.

## What are SOLID Principles?
SOLID stands for five design principles that help you write code that's easy to maintain, understand, and grow. Think of them as guidelines to keep your code organized and flexible, like rules for keeping your room tidy so you can find things later.


## Why Use SOLID?
- **Easier to Maintain**: Code is organized, so fixing one part doesn’t mess up others.
- **Easier to Grow**: You can add new features without breaking what’s already there.
- **Easier to Understand**: Each part has a clear purpose, like a well-organized toolbox.
- **More Flexible**: You can reuse or swap parts of your code in other projects.


1. **S** - Single Responsibility Principle
2. **O** - Open/Closed Principle
3. **L** - Liskov Substitution Principle
4. **I** - Interface Segregation Principle
5. **D** - Dependency Inversion Principle

-----------------------------------------

## 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
**Idea**: Every piece of your code (like a function or class) should have one job and one reason to change.

**Why?** If something does too many things, it’s harder to fix or reuse. Imagine a chef who cooks, cleans, and serves food—it’s chaotic! If you split those jobs (one person cooks, another cleans), it’s easier to manage. In code, this means each part focuses on one task, making it simpler to understand and update.
